tonce a crow and his wife built their nest atop a huge banyan tree beside a river
they were very happy there
but when the female crow laid her eggs they were in for an unpleasant shock
a huge snake who lived in a hole at the bottom of the tree came up and ate all their beautiful eggs
the crows were helpless with anger and pain
you cant let this wicked snake eat our children anymore cried the female crow bitterly
you have to find a way to save them from him she said
let us go to our friend the jackal
he is very clever
he will surely be able to help us with a solution said the male crow
they both flew to the cave in the forest where their friend the jackal lived
the jackal saw them coming
hello my friends
why do you look so sad and worried
can i help you in any way
he asked
every time my wife lays eggs in our nest a wicked snake living at the foot of the tree eats them up explained the crow
we want to get rid of him and save our children
please tell us what we can do
the jackal thought for some time
i know what you should do said the jackal and he told the plan to the crows
it was a habit of the queen to come with her maids for a bath to the river
when they did so they removed all their clothes and jewels and placed them on the river bank
on the following day the queen and her maids as usual entered the river
you know what to do right
asked the crow to his wife
yes she answered
both of them flew over the pile of clothes and jewels
the female crow swiftly picked up a precious pearl necklace in her beak
at the same time the male crow began to caw loudly to gain the attention of the queen and her maids
oh those crows have taken my pearl necklace
cried the queen
guards
she cried
get that necklace back from those pesky crows
her guards chased the crows shouting loudly
the crows flew straight to the banyan tree with the guards close behind
hearing all the noise the snake came out of his hole at the foot of the tree
immediately the female crow dropped the necklace right where the snake was
look out
there is a huge snake near the necklace alerted one guard
before the snake could realise what was happening the guards attacked him with sharp spears and killed him
the guards then picked up the necklace and took it back to their queen
the crows thanked their friend the jackal for helping them get rid of their enemy
they lived happily with their children
