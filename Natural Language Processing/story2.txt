it was a bright spring day
the sun was high in the blue sky
a herd of sheep was grazing contentedly on the hillside
the little lambs with their soft white coats and curly tails were playing among themselves
the shepherd seeing that his flock was safe and happy had fallen asleep under the spreading branches of a large old tree
suddenly an eagle swooped down from the sky
it pounced on a little lamb and carried it off so swiftly that none of the other lambs even had the time to bleat
the sleeping shepherd heard nothing
a crow was sitting on the tree under which the shepherd lay asleep
he had seen how the eagle had caught the lamb and carried it off to his nest
what a wonderful way to get dinner he thought
why do crows look for old smelly food

the crow decided to do exactly as the eagle had done
it had looked easy enough
all he had to do was to decide which sheep he wanted swoop down upon it hold it as firmly as he could in his claws and fly off with it easy
if the eagle could do it then so could he
the crow looked down at the flock of sheep to decide which sheep he wanted
just below the tree by the shepherd a big old ram was grazing
he had curling horns and a thick heavy fleece
aha
he should be a good meal for me
thought the crow greedily
he was very hungry and the thought of a large juicy ram for lunch made his mouth water
the crow swooped silently and swiftly down onto the ram just as he had seen the eagle do and grasped it firmly by its fleece
and now to fly off with it to my nest said the crow to himself
he flapped his wings with all his strength but could not lift the ram
the ram was large
he was much too heavy for the crow to carry
the crow tried again and again but without success
the ram felt the crow on its back and was most annoyed
just what do you think you are doing you pesky bird
he snapped glaring at him over his shoulder
the crow flapped harder still trying to carry the ram away
now stop that
cried the ram
go away
shoo
leave me in peace he jumped and bucked and tried to shake the crow off his back
oh oh
thought the crow alarmed at the rams fierce antics
maybe this wasnt such a good idea after all
perhaps i should look for my dinner somewhere else
i had better let the ram be
the crow tried to fly away but he found he could not move
his claws were caught in the rams thick fleece
the crow pulled his feet this way and that
he flapped his wings as hard as he could
but no matter what he did he only seemed to get stuck more firmly
oh how was he ever going to get free
the crow squawked loudly in fear and despair
the ram started running around the tree bellowing with rage
the shepherd woke up with a start
who was making that horrible noise
were his sheep in danger
he sat up
what a sight met his eyes
the ram was running round and round the tree
on his back was the crow squawking and trying to rise into the air
the shepherd began to laugh
at last wiping his eyes the shepherd stood up
he stopped the ram as he ran by and calmed him with gentle words
when the ram was still the shepherd took a pair of shears from his sack
holding the crow with one hand he deftly snipped the fleece until the crow was free
what did you think you were doing my fine friend asked the shepherd looking at the crow
playing at being an eagle were you
the shepherd burst out laughing again
the crow was too embarrassed even to croak
he wished only that the shepherd would let him go so he could fly away to his nest and hide his foolish head
finally when the shepherd let the crow go the crow flapped his wings and flew off as fast as he could
and the next time you want to be an eagle make sure you pick an animal your size
called the shepherd after him
the crow feeling silly and foolish promised himself that from now on he would only do as other crows did
